## Timeline: History of Operating Systems

### 1940s–1950s: The Beginning

* **No OS** at first — computers were programmed manually with switches or punch cards.
* **Batch Processing Systems** introduced:

  * Jobs were queued and executed one by one with no user interaction.
  * Example: IBM 701 (1952), using early batch OS.

---

### 1960s: First Real Operating Systems

* Introduction of **multiprogramming** and **time-sharing**.
* **Key OS:**

  * **CTSS (1961)** – first time-sharing system.
  * **Multics (1965)** – influential in OS design; inspired Unix.
* Concepts introduced: file systems, I/O management, CPU scheduling.

---

### 1970s: Birth of Unix & Personal Computing

* **Unix (1971)** by AT\&T Bell Labs:

  * Portable, multi-user, written in C.
  * Foundation for many future OS.
* Rise of **personal computers (PCs)**:

  * **CP/M** – early OS for Intel 8080-based PCs.

---

### 1980s: Graphical Interfaces and Microsoft

* **MS-DOS (1981)** – dominant on IBM PCs.
* **Apple Lisa (1983)** and **Macintosh (1984)** – first popular **GUI-based** OS.
* **Windows 1.0 (1985)** – Microsoft's GUI over MS-DOS.
* **UNIX variants** grow: BSD, SunOS, System V.

---

### 1990s: The GUI Revolution and Linux

* **Windows 95 (1995)** – integrated GUI + MS-DOS; major commercial success.
* **Mac OS 8/9** – Apple's continuation of GUI-based systems.
* **Linux (1991)** – open-source Unix-like OS by Linus Torvalds:

  * Grew into a global phenomenon.
* Rise of **desktop computing**.

---

### 2000s: Internet Era & Mobile Beginnings

* **Windows XP (2001)** – very popular, stable Windows version.
* **Mac OS X (2001)** – Unix-based, stable, GUI-rich Apple OS.
* **Linux distributions** grow (Ubuntu, Fedora).
* **Mobile OS emerges:**

  * **Symbian**, **Palm OS**, **Windows Mobile**.

---

### 2010s: Smartphones Take Over

* **Android (2008)** – Google’s Linux-based mobile OS; becomes dominant.
* **iOS (2007)** – Apple's OS for iPhone and iPad.
* **Windows 10 (2015)** – unified OS for PCs and tablets.
* **macOS** replaces "Mac OS X" branding.
* Growth of **cloud-based OS models** (Chrome OS, thin clients).

---

### 2020s: AI, Cloud & Cross-Platform

* OS become more **cloud-integrated** (Windows 11, ChromeOS).
* Focus on **security**, **cross-device integration**, and **AI assistants**.
* **Linux** dominates servers, cloud infrastructure, and supercomputers.
* **Windows 11 (2021)**: new design, Android app support, deeper cloud tie-ins.
* macOS powered by **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)**.
* **Fuchsia OS** (by Google) begins testing, replacing some Android parts.
