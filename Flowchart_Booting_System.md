### üìù **Explanation of Booting Stages**

1. **Power On**

   * When the computer is turned on, power flows to the motherboard and hardware components. This triggers the start of the booting process.

2. **BIOS/UEFI Execution**

   * BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (modern replacement) performs the **POST (Power-On Self Test)** to check hardware components like RAM, CPU, and keyboard.
   * If POST succeeds, BIOS/UEFI locates the configured **bootable device** (e.g., SSD, HDD, USB).

3. **Boot Device Selection**

   * BIOS/UEFI searches the boot device for a **bootloader** in the Master Boot Record (MBR) or EFI System Partition (ESP).
   * The boot order is based on user settings in BIOS/UEFI.

4. **Bootloader Loads**

   * The **bootloader** (e.g., GRUB for Linux, BOOTMGR for Windows) loads into memory.
   * It presents a boot menu if multiple OSes are installed, and then loads the **operating system kernel**.

5. **Kernel Initialization**

   * The OS **kernel** (e.g., `vmlinuz` in Linux or `ntoskrnl.exe` in Windows) is loaded into memory.
   * It initializes memory management, device drivers, and sets up the environment for user-space applications.

6. **Init/Systemd Execution**

   * The **init system** (`init`, `systemd`, `upstart`) is the first user-space process started by the kernel.
   * It handles the initialization of system services and configurations.

7. **Start Daemons & Services**

   * Background processes such as networking (`NetworkManager`), logging (`rsyslog`), or graphical interface services are started.

8. **Login Interface**

   * A graphical login manager (like `GDM`, `LightDM`, or Windows login screen) is presented, allowing the user to log in and start a user session.
